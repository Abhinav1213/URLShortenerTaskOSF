# URL Shortener ðŸ”—
A simple web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for you to readily get a shortened URL to use.

The URL shortener must be implemented at the backend together with a validator, which must be able to indicate if the generated link is actually working. The communication between backend and frontend must be handled by a RESTful API, where the results will be shown.

It's expected that on top of shortening a URL, we are also able to keep an access count, so each time the URL is accessed, we can track a list of these accumulated values and rank the URLs properly.

## User Stories
1. User can input a set of URL aiming to be shortened
2. User can get a warning message for invalid URL format input
3. User can get a set of shortened URL from the original URL provided
4. User can go to the shortened URL by clicking the  button
5. User can reset the input columns for next URL generation 
6. User can be redirected to the original URL by visiting the shortened URL
